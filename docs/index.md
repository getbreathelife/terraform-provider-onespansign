# OneSpanSign Provider

This provider interacts with the [OneSpan Sign](https://community.onespan.com/products/onespan-sign) API to configure accounts. To begin, create a [Client App](https://community.onespan.com/documentation/onespan-sign/guides/admin-guides/user/integration) and provide the provider with its **client ID** and **client secret**.

For a list of valid environment URLs, please consult [Environment URLs & IP Addresses](https://community.onespan.com/documentation/onespan-sign/guides/quick-start-guides/developer/environment-urls-ip-addresses).

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "onespansign" {
  environment_url = "https://sandbox.esignlive.com"
  client_id       = "<CLIENT_ID>"
  client_secret   = "<CLIENT_SECRET>"
}
```
